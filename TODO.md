# WaterMe! Project Roadmap & TODO

## 📝 Project Context & Notes
- **Single Garden Focus:** This system is designed for a single garden setup - no multi-garden support needed
- **No Authentication:** This is a local system for personal use - no user login/authentication required
- **Simplified UX:** No accessibility features or user preferences/customization needed - keep it simple
- **Mobile Support:** Mobile-friendly improvements are planned for post 3.x.x (Version 4.x.x) when connectivity features are added
- **Hardware Integration:** Version 2.x.x focuses strictly on physical GPIO integration and direct hardware control. All other hardware, sensors, analytics, and smart features are deferred to later versions.
- **Smart Features:** Version 3.x.x is strictly for smart features (weather, AI, analytics, scheduling, etc.).
- **Incremental Development:** Each version builds upon the previous, ensuring stable foundation before adding complexity
