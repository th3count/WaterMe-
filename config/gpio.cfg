[GPIO]
# Number of watering zones (1-8 supported)
zoneCount = 8

# GPIO pin assignments for each zone (BCM numbering)
# Zone 1 = pins[0], Zone 2 = pins[1], etc.
# Valid pins: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27
pins = 5, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

# Pump zone index (1-based, 0 = no pump zone)
# Set to 0 if no dedicated pump zone is needed
# If set, this zone will control the main pump/valve
pumpIndex = 8

# GPIO signal polarity
# true = active low (common for relay modules)
# false = active high
activeLow = True

# GPIO mode: BCM (GPIO numbering) or BOARD (physical pin numbering)
mode = BCM
